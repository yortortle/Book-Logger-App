# Book-Logger-App

The Goal of this project was to design a simple and responsive Book Logger which would allow the user to record books they've read a long with information about those books such as amount of pages and rating. I designed a statistics page to show the user how many books they've read and how many pages in total.

Technologies used: Node JS, EJS, express, javascript, and mongoDB
